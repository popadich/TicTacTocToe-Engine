# Feature Specification: Tournament System Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to expand on the python tooling to run tournament mode. There needs to be a tournament configuration file which holds a list of weight matrices, each matrix should have a label descriptor as a way of specifying it, something like \"alpha\" or \"beta\" or \"expert\", and so forth. There should also be an output file which generates a report of wins and losses and how many games were played and which weight matrix was used, win and loss counts and any other usefuls statistics. The game needs to be exercised against itself in order to find the better weight settings. The tournament runner should be written in python and the existing script tournament.py could be used as a starting point. Running a tournament should not require too many arguments just the number of game iterations and any other passed values should be set in the tournament configuration file. Running a tournament would require setting one players weight to the same for each game, and then setting different weights for the other player and cycling through all the possibilities. There is a setting for enabeling randomized moves when the board score values are identical and there are more than one moves to choose from. The random functinality needs to be tested and made to work."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a game developer, I want to run automated tournaments with different weight matrix configurations to identify the most effective heuristic weights for the 3D tic-tac-toe engine. I need to configure multiple weight matrices, run tournaments between them, and analyze the results to optimize gameplay.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a tournament configuration file with labeled weight matrices, **When** I run a tournament with 100 games, **Then** the system generates a complete report showing win/loss statistics for each weight matrix combination
2. **Given** weight matrices "alpha", "beta", and "expert" in my config, **When** I execute a tournament, **Then** each matrix plays against every other matrix as both first and second player
3. **Given** identical board evaluation scores for multiple moves, **When** randomization is enabled, **Then** the engine randomly selects among equally-scored moves rather than always choosing the first one
4. **Given** a tournament in progress, **When** games complete, **Then** results are accumulated and saved to an output report file with detailed statistics

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tournament configuration file is missing or malformed?
- How does system handle interrupted tournaments (partial completion)?
- What occurs when weight matrices produce identical game outcomes repeatedly?
- How does system behave when randomization is disabled vs enabled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST load tournament configurations from a CSV configuration file containing labeled weight matrices with tabular data structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST support descriptive labels for weight matrices (e.g., "alpha", "beta", "expert", "aggressive", "defensive")
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify the number of game iterations as a command-line parameter
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute all possible weight matrix combinations (each matrix vs every other matrix)
- **FR-005**: System MUST run games with each matrix playing as both first player and second player
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate comprehensive tournament reports including wins, losses, total games, and win percentages
- **FR-007**: System MUST support randomized move selection when multiple moves have identical evaluation scores
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate and test the randomization functionality to ensure proper operation
- **FR-009**: Tournament execution MUST require minimal command-line arguments (iterations only)
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist tournament results to an output file for analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST track detailed statistics including games played per weight matrix combination
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing tournament.py functionality as a foundation

### Key Entities

- **Tournament Configuration**: CSV file containing labeled weight matrices with descriptive names and 25 weight values per matrix (5x5 flattened)
- **Weight Matrix**: 5x5 heuristic scoring matrix with human-readable label identifier  
- **Tournament Report**: Statistical summary of all games including win/loss counts, percentages, and game counts per matrix combination
- **Game Result**: Individual game outcome linking specific weight matrices to winner and game details
- **Tournament Session**: Complete execution of all matrix combinations for specified number of iterations
